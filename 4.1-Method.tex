We introduce a distributed algorithm, DCNN, for CNN search in mobile and distributed environments. This approach, which utilizes a better safe-time, helps reduce update costs, lessen server load, shorten response times, and enhance result accuracy. DCNN consists of three phases: initialization, query processing, and information update.
