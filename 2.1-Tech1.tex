In spatial-temporal data applications, datasets comprise data objects, and both the data and queries can evolve over time. To efficiently handle large volumes of spatial data and queries, existing works~\cite{Chon:2003:RKN:942343.942352} have employed decomposition methods like grids and Voronoi diagrams..
