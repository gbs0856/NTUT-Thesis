In this section, all simulations were run on a Windows 7 system with an Intel i5-4460 3.20GHz CPU and 8GB of memory. For all simulation experiments, the final results represent the average of 100 queries. The mobility model used is Random Waypoint (RWP), while the underlying routing protocol is AODV.
