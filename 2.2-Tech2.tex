In the unstructured MP2P systems, the general solution for increasing the data accessibility is to replicate data items in the distributed cache on different nodes. It is difficult and complicated to maintain data items and keep the consistency of replicas in the MP2P systems because of the unpredictable mobility of the nodes. However, the consistency of replicas should be guaranteed; otherwise, the users may obtain the dirty or old data. Thus, the consistency of data items and replicas has become an important issue on the data management in unstructured MP2P systems and many approaches have been proposed to settle the data consistency problem in the unstructured MP2P~\cite{springerlink:10.1007/s11277-006-9238-z}.
