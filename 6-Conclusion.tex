This dissertation introduces efficient distributed query processing and data consistency management approaches for mobile networks. These methods establish fundamental principles for handling queries and maintaining shared data in distributed environments. However, with the rapid advancement of wireless technologies and information sciences, computing environments are evolving quickly. Many applications are significantly affected by Big Data generated from human behavior, giving rise to new networks and applications such as Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs), Mobile Social Networks (MSNs), and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). In light of these developments, the dissertation could potentially be extended to address these emerging environments in the future.
